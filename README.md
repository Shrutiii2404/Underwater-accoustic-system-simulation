# Simulation of Underwater Acoustic System

## Project Overview
This project aims to simulate an **underwater acoustic system** to analyze signal transmission, noise interference, and underwater communication challenges. The focus is on developing an efficient and low-cost solution **without using MATLAB**, integrating real-time visualization on a laptop.

## Features
- **Acoustic Signal Processing:** Simulates underwater sound wave propagation.
- **Noise Interference Analysis:** Evaluates the impact of underwater noise.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Uses alternative tools to MATLAB for data representation.
- **Low-Cost Implementation:** Optimized for resource-efficient simulation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** (c)
- **Libraries/Tools:** N/A)
-

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/underwater-acoustic-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd underwater-acoustic-simulation
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Status
This project is currently in development as part of my **7th-semester coursework** in **Electronics and Telecommunication** at **GEC Raipur**. Future improvements include enhanced signal processing techniques and real-world testing.
